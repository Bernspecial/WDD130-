    <h2>Michael Bernard Olayemi</h2>
    <h2>(aka) Bernspecial</h2>
    <p>My name is Michael Bernard Olayemi and my friends call me Bernspecial. I'm from Nigeria, i'm heading down 
    to a bachelor degree, to become a better <br>programmer because i'm a creative person.</p> 
    I only have one hubby and that's talking.
    I'm not married yet but i do have a girlfriend and hope to have children and grandchildren with her some day, 
    <br>I'm into sound engineering
    but the job is not producing more income for me, so i'm seeking for a driving job just to give me enough time to face my studies.
    <br>To say
    one thing i love about BYU-Idaho is punishment because i've many things</br> i love about BYU-Idaho but just to say one thing, one thing i
    love about BYU-Idaho is the opportunity they've <br>extended to people like me to have a proper access to education. Acquiring BS in programming 
    is my aim for now. 
    <p>One advantage i see from learning web design is improving my creativity, i'm taking this course because it'll help me to be self-employed
        and get to me meet great people in life, <br>what i hope to get out of this course is success and ability to conquer any problem that comes
        from it. in personal life, i'll use the information i get from this<br/> course to fend for my family and myself and professionally use it
        to help the technology world for the comfortability of the world/users.
