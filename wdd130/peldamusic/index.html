                <p class="home-page">
                    Entertainment is any action, event or activity for the purpose of entertaining and eliciting the interest of an audience. 
                    It is the presence of an audience that makes any private activity from recreation or leisure into entertainment. The audience 
                    may play a passive role, such as when watching a play, opera, television show or movie; or an active role, as in the case of 
                    games. The entertainment can be public or private and involve a formal and predetermined performance, as in the case of the 
                    theater or concerts, or a spontaneous performance, as in the case of games. Many forms of entertainment are cross-cutting 
                    throughout history and cultures and evolve in the light of cultural and technological changes. Movies and electronic games, 
                    for example, while making use of new media and media, continue to tell stories and make use of music. The festivals dedicated 
                    to music, theater or dance allow the entertainment of an audience over several consecutive days.
                    Entertainment provides fun, personal satisfaction and good mood. In certain circumstances and contexts, entertainment has a 
                    serious purpose, as in the case of celebrations, religious festivities or satires. As such, there is a possibility that what 
                    appears to be entertainment may also be a form of cultural and intellectual development. The appeal of entertainment, along 
                    with its ability to use different media and its potential for creative adaptations, has ensured the continuity and longevity 
                    of many forms, themes, images and social structures.
