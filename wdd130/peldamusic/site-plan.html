        What Is Entertainment:
        Entertainment is any action, event or activity for the purpose of entertaining and eliciting the interest of an audience. 
        It is the presence of an audience that makes any private activity from recreation or leisure into entertainment. The audience 
        may play a passive role, such as when watching a play, opera, television show or movie; or an active role, as in the case of 
        games. The entertainment can be public or private and involve a formal and predetermined performance, as in the case of the 
        theater or concerts, or a spontaneous performance, as in the case of games. Many forms of entertainment are cross-cutting 
        throughout history and cultures and evolve in the light of cultural and technological changes. Movies and electronic games, 
        for example, while making use of new media and media, continue to tell stories and make use of music. The festivals dedicated 
        to music, theater or dance allow the entertainment of an audience over several consecutive days."
        "Entertainment provides fun, personal satisfaction and good mood. In certain circumstances and contexts, entertainment has a 
        serious purpose, as in the case of celebrations, religious festivities or satires. As such, there is a possibility that what 
        appears to be entertainment may also be a form of cultural and intellectual development. The appeal of entertainment, along 
        with its ability to use different media and its potential for creative adaptations, has ensured the continuity and longevity 
        of many forms, themes, images and social structures.
